[E003] - Added Required Property in Request contract
====================================================================

Rationale
---------
Adding a required property to an object used in requests leads client request to fail if the property is not present.


Mitigation
----------
A possible mitigation consists of adding the property as optional with an associated default value.
In this case, the client requests donâ€™t fail to validate and the service can assume that the property is always set.

Example
-------
Old Swagger Specs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. literalinclude:: examples/E003/old.yaml
   :name: Old Swagger Spec
   :language: yaml
   :linenos:

New Swagger Specs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. literalinclude:: examples/E003/new.yaml
   :name: New Swagger Spec
   :language: yaml
   :emphasize-lines: 16-17
   :linenos:


Backward Incompatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The following snippet triggers the incompatibility error.

.. literalinclude:: examples/E003/tester.py
   :language: py
   :linenos:
